# Hippodrome Game
Simply Horse race console game in java.

A new snapshot of the racetrack is displayed every half second. 
Use the mouse to decrease the size of the console so that only one "snapshot" is visible at a time and remains in the same place. 
Then you can watch the race live and even commentate.
